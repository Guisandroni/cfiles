<font size="5"><b>GCC Command-Line Options</b></font>
<hr>
<p>This part of the documentation is a modified version of the
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Invoking-GCC.html">Command-Line Options</a>
section of the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/">GCC Manual</a>.
Therefore it is licensed under the
<a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/gnugpl.html#gnufdl">GNU Free Documentation License</a>.
<br><br>
This section describes the options supported by <code>gcc</code>,
the driver program of the GNU Compiler Collection, whose C compiler
and assembler are used here.  This program is called either by
<code>tigcc</code> or by the IDE.  <code>tigcc</code>
simulates some of these options itself, namely <b>'-E'</b>,
<b>'-S'</b>, and <b>'-c'</b>, and it also has some additional ones.
In the IDE, there is an item in the project settings where you can
set the options described here, with some exceptions, including the
switches mentioned above.
<br><br>
TIGCC normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking
all in one step, and finally produces a file which is executable on
the calculator.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <b>'-c'</b> option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
<br><br>
Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
In fact, only those options which may be more or less useful with TIGCC
are mentioned here (although we didn't check whether all of them are
really usable in TIGCC).  For more info about standard options that are
recognized by the compiler, read the
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Invoking-GCC.html">official manual</a>.
<br><br>
We suggest that you use the <b>'-O2'</b> switch in all of your
compilations; it increases speed and decreases the program size at the
cost of compilation time.
<br><br>
<code>tigcc</code> accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may <i>not</i> be grouped: <b>'-dr'</b> is very different from <b>'-d
-r'</b>.
<br><br>
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify <b>'-L'</b> more than once,
the directories are searched in the order specified.
<br><br>
Many options have long names starting with <b>'-f'</b> or with
<b>'-W'</b> - for example, <b>'-fforce-mem'</b>,
<b>'-fstrength-reduce'</b>, <b>'-Wformat'</b> and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
<b>'-ffoo'</b> would be <b>'-fno-foo'</b>.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.</p>

<h2><a name="SEC3"><u>Options Available in the Command Line Compiler</u></a></h2>
<p>These options apply only to the command line compiler.  If you want to use
the IDE instead, you do not need to worry about these topics.
<br><br>
<code>tigcc</code> has an important difference to the standard program
<code>gcc</code>: <code>tigcc</code> always overwrites assembly or
object files.  For example, if a file <code>test.c</code> is compiled, the
files <code>test.s</code> and <code>test.o</code> will be created and
overwritten if necessary, but they will automatically be deleted again if
neither <b>'-c'</b> nor <b>'-S'</b> are specified.
<br><br>
Another important difference is that <code>tigcc</code> always looks for
libraries in the <code>'Lib'</code> subfolder of the installation.</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>-pack <i>varname</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Compress the file generated during compilation.
<i>varname</i> is the name of the on-calc packed variable.  Although
<i>varname</i> cannot have an extension, the variable on the calculator will
always have the extension <code>ppg</code>.  <i>varname</i> cannot be the
same as the on-calc name of the program itself.  When you use this switch,
two files will be created; one with the extension <code>.89y</code> or
<code>.9xy</code>, and one <code>.89z</code> or <code>.9xz</code> file.
<br><br>
This option comes from
<a href="mailto:thomas.nussbaumer@gmx.net">Thomas Nussbaumer</a>'s
TIGCC Tools Suite, where this feature is called "ExePack Technology."
You can read about it on the official
<a href="http://tict.ticalc.org/">TI-Chess Team site</a>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-q</b></p></dt><dd><p>Keep as quiet as possible while assembling and linking.  This option is
not needed by the compiler because it is always quiet, but the linker and
especially the assembler output some information.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-v0</b></p></dt><dd><p>This switch is an addition to the <b>'-v'</b> switch.  It tells TIGCC to
output only the commands that are run directly.  This was the default in some
previous releases.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-g</b></p></dt><dd><p>The <b>'-g'</b> switch in GCC turns on debugging information in the
preferred format for the target. In TIGCC, this is DWARF 2, which can be used
with a GDB-enabled TiEmu.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-standalone</b></p></dt><dd><p>Do not link against <code>tigcc.a</code>.  All of GCC's internal
functions are implemented in this library, as well as all non-TIOS functions.
Using one of these will result in an error from the linker.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-ar</b></p></dt><dd><p>Create an archive (a static library) instead of a program.  The resulting
file will have an <code>.a</code> ending.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-bsr</b></p></dt><dd><p>This option is ignored for compatibility.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p>In addition to these options, the <code>tigcc</code> program also accepts
most of the <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/ld.html#invocation">linker options</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="SEC4"><u>Options Controlling the Kind of Output</u></a></h2>
<p>Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  The first three
stages apply to an individual source file, and end by producing an
object file; linking combines all the object files (those newly
compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable file.
<br><br>
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done (some of these apply only to TIGCC):</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b><i>file</i>.c</b></p></dt><dd><p>C source code which must be preprocessed.
</p></dd><dt><p><b><i>file</i>.s</b></p></dt><dd><p>GNU Assembler code.
</p></dd><dt><p><b><i>file</i>.S</b></p></dt><dd><p>GNU Assembler code which must be preprocessed.
</p></dd><dt><p><b><i>file</i>.asm</b></p></dt><dd><p>A68k Assembler code.
</p></dd><dt><p><b><i>file</i>.o</b></p></dt><dd><p>COFF object file to be linked using <code>ld</code>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b><i>file</i>.a</b></p></dt><dd><p>Static library (function archive) to be linked using <code>ld</code>.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p>You can specify the input language explicitly with the <b>'-x'</b> option:</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>-x <i>language</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Specify explicitly the <i>language</i> for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next <b>'-x'</b> option.  Possible values for <i>language</i> are:
<br>
<code>
c  c-header  cpp-output
c++  c++-cpp-output
objective-c  objc-cpp-output
assembler  assembler-with-cpp
ada
f77  f77-cpp-input  ratfor
java
treelang
</code></p></dd><dt><p><b>-x none</b></p></dt><dd><p>Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if <b>'-x'</b>
has not been used at all).
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-pass-exit-codes</b></p></dt><dd><p>Normally the <code>gcc</code> program will exit with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
<b>'-pass-exit-codes'</b>, the <code>gcc</code> program will instead return with
numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned an error
indication.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p>If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
<b>'-x'</b> (or filename suffixes) to tell <code>gcc</code> where to start, and
one of the options <b>'-c'</b>, <b>'-S'</b>, or <b>'-E'</b> to say where
<code>gcc</code> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
<b>'-x cpp-output -E'</b>) instruct <code>gcc</code> to do nothing at all.</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>-c</b></p></dt><dd><p>Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.
<br><br>
By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix <code>.c</code>, <code>.i</code>, <code>.s</code>, etc., with <code>.o</code>.
<br><br>
Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-S</b></p></dt><dd><p>Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.
<br><br>
By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix <code>.c</code>, <code>.i</code>, etc., with <code>.s</code>.
<br><br>
Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-E</b></p></dt><dd><p>Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.
<br><br>
Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-o <i>file</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Place output in file <i>file</i>.  This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
<br><br>
Since only one output file can be specified, it does not make sense to
use <b>'-o'</b> when compiling more than one input file, unless you are
producing an executable file as output.
<br><br>
If <b>'-o'</b> is not specified, the default is to put an executable file
in <code>a.out</code>, the object file for <code><i>source</i>.<i>suffix</i></code> in
<code><i>source</i>.o</code>, its assembler file in <code><i>source</i>.s</code>, and
all preprocessed C source on standard output.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-v</b></p></dt><dd><p>Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-###</b></p></dt><dd><p>Like <b>'-v'</b> except the commands are not executed and all command
arguments are quoted.  This is useful for shell scripts to capture the
driver-generated command lines.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-pipe</b></p></dt><dd><p>Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has
no trouble.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>--help</b></p></dt><dd><p>Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line options
understood by <code>gcc</code>.  If the <b>'-v'</b> option is also specified
then <b>'--help'</b> will also be passed on to the various processes
invoked by <code>gcc</code>, so that they can display the command line options
they accept.  If the <b>'-W'</b> option is also specified then command
line options which have no documentation associated with them will also
be displayed.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>--target-help</b></p></dt><dd><p>Print (on the standard output) a description of target specific command
line options for each tool.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>--version</b></p></dt><dd><p>Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked GCC.</p>
</dd></dl>

<hr>
<h2><a name="SEC6"><u>Options Controlling C Dialect</u></a></h2>
<p>The following options control the dialect of C that the compiler accepts:</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>-ansi</b></p></dt><dd><p>Support all ISO C89 programs.
This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C89,
such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, and
some predefined macros that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO trigraph feature, and disables recognition of C++ style
<code>//</code> comments as well as the <code>inline</code> keyword.
<br><br>
The alternate keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__extension__</code>,
<code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code> continue to work despite
<b>'-ansi'</b>.  You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <b>'-ansi'</b>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <code>__unix__</code> are also available, with or
without <b>'-ansi'</b>.
<br><br>
The <b>'-ansi'</b> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <b>'-pedantic'</b> is required in
addition to <b>'-ansi'</b>.  See <a href="#SEC8">Warning Options</a>.
<br><br>
The macro <code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code> is predefined when the <b>'-ansi'</b>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.
<br><br>
Functions which would normally be built in but do not have semantics
defined by ISO C (such as <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/alloc.html#alloca">alloca</a>) are not built-in
functions with <b>'-ansi'</b> is used.  See <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/gnuexts.html#SEC104">Other
built-in functions provided by GCC</a> for details of the functions
affected.
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> At the moment, the TIGCC library depends heavily on GNU C extensions,
so you cannot use the <b>'-ansi'</b> switch in TIGCC.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-std=<i>standard</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Determine the language standard.  A value for <i>standard</i> must be provided;
provided; possible values are
</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>c89</b>
<br><b>iso9899:1990</b></p></dt><dd><p>ISO C90 (same as <b>'-ansi'</b>).
</p></dd><dt><p><b>iso9899:199409</b></p></dt><dd><p>ISO C90 as modified in amendment 1.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>c99</b>
<br><b>c9x</b>
<br><b>iso9899:1999</b>
<br><b>iso9899:199x</b></p></dt><dd><p>ISO C99.  Note that this standard is not yet fully supported; see
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.3/c99status.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.3/c99status.html</a> for more information.  The
names <code>c9x</code> and <code>iso9899:199x</code> are deprecated.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>gnu89</b></p></dt><dd><p>Default, ISO C90 plus GNU extensions (including some C99 features).
</p></dd><dt><p><b>gnu99</b>
<br><b>gnu9x</b></p></dt><dd><p>ISO C99 plus GNU extensions.  When ISO C99 is fully implemented in GCC,
this will become the default.  The name <code>gnu9x</code> is deprecated.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p>
Even when this option is not specified, you can still use some of the
features of newer standards in so far as they do not conflict with
previous C standards.  For example, you may use <code>__restrict__</code> even
when <b>'-std=c99'</b> is not specified.
<br><br>
The <b>'-std'</b> options specifying some version of ISO C have the same
effects as <b>'-ansi'</b>, except that features that were not in ISO C90
but are in the specified version (for example, <code>//</code> comments and
the <code>inline</code> keyword in ISO C99) are not disabled.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-aux-info <i>filename</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions
declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including those in header
files.  This option is silently ignored in any language other than C.
<br><br>
Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (<code>I</code>, <code>N</code> for new or
<code>O</code> for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
definition (<code>C</code> or <code>F</code>, respectively, in the following
character).  In the case of function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of
arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fno-asm</b></p></dt><dd><p>Do not recognize <code>asm</code>, <code>inline</code> or <code>typeof</code> as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code>
instead.  <b>'-ansi'</b> implies <b>'-fno-asm'</b>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fno-builtin</b>
<br><b>-fno-builtin-<i>function</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
<code>__builtin_</code> as prefix.  See <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/gnuexts.html#SEC104">Other built-in
functions provided by GCC</a> for details of the functions affected,
including those which are not built-in functions when <b>'-ansi'</b> or
<b>'-std'</b> options for strict ISO C conformance are used because they
do not have an ISO standard meaning.
<br><br>
GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/alloc.html#alloca">alloca</a> may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.
<br><br>
With the <b>'-fno-builtin-<i>function</i>'</b> option,
only the built-in function <i>function</i> is
disabled.  <i>function</i> must not begin with <code>__builtin_</code>.  If a
function is named this is not built-in in this version of GCC, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
<b>'-fbuiltin-<i>function</i>'</b> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using <b>'-fno-builtin'</b> or
<b>'-ffreestanding'</b>, you may define macros such as:</p>
<pre>#define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
#define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))
</pre>

</dd><dt><p><b>-fhosted</b></p></dt><dd><p>Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.  This implies
<b>'-fbuiltin'</b>.  A hosted environment is one in which the

type of <code>int</code>.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.
This is equivalent to <b>'-fno-freestanding'</b>.
<br><br>
Although TI calculators are not really hosted environments, <b>'-fhosted'</b>
is kept as the default.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-ffreestanding</b></p></dt><dd><p>Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.  This

</p></dd><dt><p><b>-trigraphs</b></p></dt><dd><p>Support ISO C trigraphs.  The <b>'-ansi'</b> option (and <b>'-std'</b>

an additional preprocessing step after normal preprocessing but before

<br><br>

</p></dd><dt><p><b>-traditional</b>
<br><b>-traditional-cpp</b></p></dt><dd><p>Formerly, these options caused GCC to attempt to emulate a pre-standard

In TIGCC, the default is <code>signed char</code>.
<br><br>
Ideally, a portable program should always use <code>signed&nbsp;char</code> or
<code>unsigned&nbsp;char</code> when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain <code>char</code> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.
<br><br>
The type <code>char</code> is always a distinct type from each of
<code>signed&nbsp;char</code> or <code>unsigned&nbsp;char</code>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fsigned-char</b></p></dt><dd><p>Let the type <code><a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/keywords.html#int">char</a></code> be signed, like <code>signed&nbsp;char</code>.
<br><br>
Note that this is equivalent to <b>'-fno-unsigned-char'</b>, which is
the negative form of <b>'-funsigned-char'</b>.  Likewise, the option
<b>'-fno-signed-char'</b> is equivalent to <b>'-funsigned-char'</b>.

<h2><a name="SEC8"><u>Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</u></a></h2>
<p>Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
<br><br>
You can request many specific warnings with options beginning <b>'-W'</b>,
for example <b>'-Wimplicit'</b> to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning <b>'-Wno-'</b> to turn off warnings;
for example, <b>'-Wno-implicit'</b>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.
<br><br>
The following options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced
by GCC.</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>-fsyntax-only</b></p></dt><dd><p>Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-pedantic</b></p></dt><dd><p>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C.  This option follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <b>'-std'</b> option used.
<br><br>
Valid ISO C programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few will require <b>'-ansi'</b> or a
<b>'-std'</b> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
<br><br>
<b>'-pedantic'</b> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with <code>__</code>.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<code>__extension__</code>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
See <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/gnuexts.html#SEC100">Alternate Keywords</a>.
<br><br>
Some users try to use <b>'-pedantic'</b> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all - only those for which
ISO C <i>requires</i> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
<br><br>
A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <b>'-pedantic'</b>.  The GNU team doesn't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
<br><br>
Where the standard specified with <b>'-std'</b> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as <code>gnu89</code> or <code>gnu99</code>, there is a
corresponding <u>base standard</u>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <b>'-pedantic'</b> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It would not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-pedantic-errors</b></p></dt><dd><p>Like <b>'-pedantic'</b>, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.

specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes (see <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/gnuexts.html#SEC85_format">format</a>).
<br><br>
Since <b>'-Wformat'</b> also checks for null format arguments for
several functions, <b>'-Wformat'</b> also implies <b>'-Wnonnull'</b>.
<br><br>
<b>'-Wformat'</b> is included in <b>'-Wall'</b>.  For more control over some
aspects of format checking, the options
<b>'-Wno-format-extra-args'</b>, <b>'-Wno-format-zero-length'</b>,
<b>'-Wformat-nonliteral'</b>, <b>'-Wformat-security'</b>, and

</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Wno-format-extra-args</b></p></dt><dd><p>If <b>'-Wformat'</b> is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a

that such arguments are ignored.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Wno-format-zero-length</b></p></dt><dd><p>If <b>'-Wformat'</b> is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.
The C standard specifies that zero-length formats are allowed.

format string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments,
as in <code>printf&nbsp;(foo);</code>.  This may be a security hole if the format

currently a subset of what <b>'-Wformat-nonliteral'</b> warns about, but

<pre>int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };
</pre>

</dd><dt><p><b>-Wparentheses</b></p></dt><dd><p>Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.
<br><br>
Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
<code><a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/keywords.html#if">if</a></code> statement an <code><a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/keywords.html#if">else</a></code> branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:</p>
<pre>{
  if (a)
    if (b)
      foo ();
  else
    bar ();
}
</pre>
<p>In C, every <code>else</code> branch belongs to the innermost possible <code>if</code>
statement, which in this example is <code>if&nbsp;(b)</code>.  This is often not
what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example by the
indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential for this
confusion, GCC will issue a warning when this flag is specified.
To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost
<code>if</code> statement so there is no way the <code>else</code> could belong to
the enclosing <code>if</code>.  The resulting code would look like this:</p>
<pre>{
  if (a)
    {
      if (b)
        foo ();
      else
        bar ();
    }
}
</pre>

</dd><dt><p><b>-Wsequence-point</b></p></dt><dd><p>Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C standard.
<br><br>
The C standard defines the order in which expressions in a C program are
evaluated in terms of <u>sequence points</u>, which represent a partial
ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those executed
before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These occur
after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part of a
larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>?&nbsp;:</code> or <code>,</code> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
<br><br>
It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C standard specifies that "Between the
previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value
modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.  Furthermore,
the prior value shall be read only to determine the value to be
stored.".  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
<br><br>
Examples of code with undefined behavior are <code>a&nbsp;=&nbsp;a++;</code>, <code>a[n]
=&nbsp;b[n++]</code> and <code>a[i++]&nbsp;=&nbsp;i;</code>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
<br><br>
The C standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</a>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Wreturn-type</b></p></dt><dd><p>Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults to

<br><br>
In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
either specify <b>'-W -Wunused'</b> or separately specify
<b>'-Wunused-parameter'</b>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Wuninitialized</b></p></dt><dd><p>Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized or
if a variable may be clobbered by a <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/setjmp.html#setjmp">setjmp</a> call
(I am not sure whether <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/setjmp.html#setjmp">setjmp</a> problems may be detected in TIGCC).
<br><br>
These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
because they require data flow information that is computed only
when optimizing.  If you don't specify <b>'-O'</b>, you simply won't
get these warnings.
<br><br>
These warnings occur only for variables that are candidates for
register allocation.  Therefore, they do not occur for a variable that
is declared <code><a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/keywords.html#volatile">volatile</a></code>, or whose address is taken, or whose size
is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not occur for
structures, unions or arrays, even when they are in registers.
<br><br>
Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.
<br><br>
These warnings are made optional because GCC is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:</p>
<pre>{
  int x;
  switch (y)
    {
    case 1: x = 1;
      break;
    case 2: x = 4;
      break;
    case 3: x = 5;
    }
  foo (x);
}
</pre>
<p>If the value of <i>y</i> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <i>x</i> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn't know this.  Here is
another common case:</p>
<pre>{
  int save_y;
  if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
  ...
  if (change_y) y = save_y;
}
</pre>
<p>This has no bug because <i>save_y</i> is used only if it is set.
<br><br>
This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/setjmp.html#longjmp">longjmp</a>.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation
(although I am not sure whether they can be caught at all in TIGCC).
<br><br>
The compiler sees only the calls to <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/setjmp.html#setjmp">setjmp</a>.  It cannot know
where <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/setjmp.html#longjmp">longjmp</a> will be called; in fact, an interrupt handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/setjmp.html#longjmp">longjmp</a> cannot
in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.
<br><br>
Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/gnuexts.html#SEC85_noreturn">noreturn</a>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Wunknown-pragmas</b></p></dt><dd><p>Warn when a <code><a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/cpp.html#SEC46">#pragma</a></code> directive is encountered which is not understood by

for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the case if
the warnings were only enabled by the <b>'-Wall'</b> command line option.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Wstrict-aliasing</b></p></dt><dd><p>This option is only active when <b>'-fstrict-aliasing'</b> is active.
It warns about code which might break the strict aliasing rules that the

<p>The following <b>'-W...'</b> options are not implied by <b>'-Wall'</b>.
Some of them warn about constructions that users generally do not

in some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning.</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>-W</b></p></dt><dd><p>Print extra warning messages for these events:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A function can return either with or without a value.  (Falling

a value.)  For example, this function would evoke such a
warning:</p>
<pre>foo (a)
{
  if (a &gt; 0)
    return a;
}
</pre>

</li>
<li><p>An expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma expression
contains no side effects.
To suppress the warning, cast the unused expression to void.
For example, an expression such as <code>x[i,j]</code> will cause a warning,
but <code>x[(void)i,j]</code> will not.
</p></li>
<li><p>An unsigned value is compared against zero with <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&lt;=</code>.
</p></li>
<li><p>A comparison like <code>x&lt;=y&lt;=z</code> appears; this is equivalent to
<code>(x&lt;=y&nbsp;?&nbsp;1&nbsp;:&nbsp;0)&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;z</code>, which is a different interpretation from
that of ordinary mathematical notation.
</p></li>
<li><p>Storage-class specifiers like <code>static</code> are not the first things in
a declaration.  According to the C Standard, this usage is obsolescent.
</p></li>
<li><p>The return type of a function has a type qualifier such as <code>const</code>.
Such a type qualifier has no effect, since the value returned by a
function is not an lvalue.  (But don't warn about the GNU extension of
<code>volatile&nbsp;void</code> return types.  That extension will be warned about
if <b>'-pedantic'</b> is specified.)
</p></li>
<li><p>If <b>'-Wall'</b> or <b>'-Wunused'</b> is also specified, warn about unused
arguments.
</p></li>
<li><p>A comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an
incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
(But don't warn if <b>'-Wno-sign-compare'</b> is also specified.)
</p></li>
<li><p>An aggregate has a partly bracketed initializer.
For example, the following code would evoke such a warning,
because braces are missing around the initializer for <i>x</i>.<i>h</i>:</p>
<pre>struct s { int f, g; };
struct t { struct s h; int i; };
struct t x = { 1, 2, 3 };
</pre>

</li>
<li><p>An aggregate has an initializer which does not initialize all members.
For example, the following code would cause such a warning, because
<i>x</i>.<i>h</i> would be implicitly initialized to zero:</p>
<pre>struct s { int f, g, h; };
struct s x = { 3, 4 };
</pre>

</li>
</ul>

</dd><dt><p><b>-Wno-div-by-zero</b></p></dt><dd><p>Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.  Floating point

Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command line option tells
GCC to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using <b>'-Wall'</b> in conjunction with this
option will <i>not</i> warn about unknown pragmas in system
headers - for that, <b>'-Wunknown-pragmas'</b> must also be used.
<br><br>
Note that the TIGCC Library header files are not included as system header
files.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Wfloat-equal</b></p></dt><dd><p>Warn if floating point values are used in equality comparisons.
<br><br>
The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
would check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but does not in ISO C.
</p></li>
<li><p>In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive

traditional implementations would not recognize <code><a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/cpp.html#SEC36">#elif</a></code>, so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.

<li><p>A function-like macro that appears without arguments.
</p></li>
<li><p>The unary plus operator.

<li><p>The <code>U</code> integer constant suffix, or the <code>F</code> or <code>L</code> floating point

because that feature is already a gcc extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.</p></li>

These warnings will help you find at
compile time code that can try to write into a string constant, but
only if you have been very careful about using <code>const</code> in

attributes might be appropriate for any function that calls a function

Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For

<br><br>
This option is intended to warn when the compiler detects that at
least a whole line of source code will never be executed, because
some condition is never satisfied or because it is after a
procedure that never returns.
<br><br>
It is possible for this option to produce a warning even though there
are circumstances under which part of the affected line can be executed,
so care should be taken when removing apparently-unreachable code.
<br><br>
For instance, when a function is inlined, a warning may mean that the
line is unreachable in only one inlined copy of the function.
<br><br>
This option is not made part of <b>'-Wall'</b> because in a debugging
version of a program there is often substantial code which checks
correct functioning of the program and is, hopefully, unreachable

Even with this option, the compiler will not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.
<br><br>
The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the

<h2><a name="SEC9"><u>Options for Debugging Your Program</u></a></h2>
<p>GCC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC.
However, this manual is not meant to explain anything about the internals of
GCC, so you will have to go to the
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html">official version</a>
of this page on the internet if you want to debug GCC itself.
<br><br>
In order to debug TIGCC programs, you need a GDB-enabled version of the
TiEmu emulator.</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>-g</b></p></dt><dd><p>Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs is the default for the MC68000).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.
Note that the <code>tigcc</code> frontend defaults to DWARF 2 debugging
information instead, see <a href="#SEC3">Options Available in the
Command Line Compiler</a>.
<br><br>
Unlike most other C compilers, GCC allows you to use <b>'-g'</b> with
<b>'-O'</b>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.
<br><br>
Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
<br><br>
The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-ggdb</b></p></dt><dd><p>Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the
most expressive format available, including GDB extensions if at all
possible.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-gstabs</b></p></dt><dd><p>Produce debugging information in stabs format.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-gstabs+</b></p></dt><dd><p>Produce debugging information in stabs format,
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-gcoff</b></p></dt><dd><p>Produce debugging information in COFF format.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-g<i>level</i></b>
<br><b>-ggdb<i>level</i></b>
<br><b>-gstabs<i>level</i></b>
<br><b>-gcoff<i>level</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Request debugging information and also use <i>level</i> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.
<br><br>
Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.
<br><br>
Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <b>'-g3'</b>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-p</b></p></dt><dd><p>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <code>prof</code>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.
This option is probably useless in TIGCC.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-pg</b></p></dt><dd><p>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <code>gprof</code>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.
This option is probably useless in TIGCC.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Q</b></p></dt><dd><p>Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-save-temps</b></p></dt><dd><p>Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling <code>foo.c</code> with <b>'-c -save-temps'</b> would produce files
<code>foo.i</code> and <code>foo.s</code>, as well as <code>foo.o</code>.  This creates a
preprocessed <code>foo.i</code> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.</p>
</dd></dl>

<hr>
<h2><a name="SEC10"><u>Options That Control Optimization</u></a></h2>
<p>These options control various sorts of optimizations.
<br><br>
Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.
<br><br>
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
<br><br>
Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed.</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>-O</b>
<br><b>-O1</b></p></dt><dd><p>Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.
<br><br>
With <b>'-O'</b>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.
<br><br>
<b>'-O'</b> turns on the following optimization flags:
-fdefer-pop -fmerge-constants -fthread-jumps -floop-optimize 
-fcrossjumping -fif-conversion -fif-conversion2 -fdelayed-branch 
-fguess-branch-probability -fcprop-registers
<br><br>
<b>'-O'</b> also turns on <b>'-fomit-frame-pointer'</b> on machines
where doing so does not interfere with debugging.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-O2</b></p></dt><dd><p>Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The compiler does not
perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify <b>'-O2'</b>.
As compared to <b>'-O'</b>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.
<br><br>
<b>'-O2'</b> turns on all optimization flags specified by <b>'-O'</b>.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
<br>
<code>
-fforce-mem -foptimize-sibling-calls -fstrength-reduce 
-fcse-follow-jumps  -fcse-skip-blocks -frerun-cse-after-loop  
-frerun-loop-opt -fgcse   -fgcse-lm   -fgcse-sm 
-fdelete-null-pointer-checks -fexpensive-optimizations -fregmove 
-fschedule-insns  -fschedule-insns2 -fsched-interblock -fsched-spec 
-fcaller-saves -fpeephole2 -freorder-blocks  -freorder-functions 
-fstrict-aliasing -falign-functions  -falign-jumps -falign-loops  
-falign-labels
</code>
<br><br>
Please note the warning under <b>'-fgcse'</b> about
invoking <b>'-O2'</b> on programs that use computed gotos.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-O3</b></p></dt><dd><p>Optimize yet more.  <b>'-O3'</b> turns on all optimizations specified by
<b>'-O2'</b> and also turns on the <b>'-finline-functions'</b> and
<b>'-frename-registers'</b> options.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-O0</b></p></dt><dd><p>Do not optimize.  This is the default.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Os</b></p></dt><dd><p>Optimize for size.  <b>'-Os'</b> enables all <b>'-O2'</b> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size.
<br><br>
<b>'-Os'</b> disables the following optimization flags:
-falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops -falign-labels  -freorder-blocks -fprefetch-loop-arrays
<br><br>
If you use multiple <b>'-O'</b> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p>Options of the form <b>'-f<i>flag</i>'</b> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <b>'-ffoo'</b> would be <b>'-fno-foo'</b>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed: the one you typically will
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing <b>'no-'</b>
or adding it.
<br><br>
The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <b>'-O'</b> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when "fine-tuning" of
optimizations to be performed is desired.</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>-fno-defer-pop</b></p></dt><dd><p>Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.
<br><br>
Disabled at levels <b>'-O'</b>, <b>'-O2'</b>, <b>'-O3'</b>, <b>'-Os'</b>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fforce-mem</b></p></dt><dd><p>Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
arithmetic on them.  This produces better code by making all memory
references potential common subexpressions.  When they are not common
subexpressions, instruction combination should eliminate the separate
register-load.
<br><br>
Enabled at levels <b>'-O2'</b>, <b>'-O3'</b>, <b>'-Os'</b>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fforce-addr</b></p></dt><dd><p>Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code just as
<b>'-fforce-mem'</b> may.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fomit-frame-pointer</b></p></dt><dd><p>Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines (not on TIGCC though, thanks to unwinding tables).
<br><br>
This option now works with floating point arithmetic.
<br><br>
Enabled at levels <b>'-O'</b>, <b>'-O2'</b>, <b>'-O3'</b>, <b>'-Os'</b>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-foptimize-sibling-calls</b></p></dt><dd><p>Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.
<br><br>
Enabled at levels <b>'-O2'</b>, <b>'-O3'</b>, <b>'-Os'</b>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fno-inline</b></p></dt><dd><p>Don't pay attention to the <code>inline</code> keyword.  Normally this option
is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline.
Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded inline.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-finline-functions</b></p></dt><dd><p>Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way.
<br><br>
If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <code>static</code>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.
<br><br>
Enabled at level <b>'-O3'</b>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-finline-limit=<i>n</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>By default, gcc limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows the control of this limit for functions that are explicitly marked as
inline (i.e., marked with the inline keyword).
<i>n</i> is the size of functions that can be inlined in
number of pseudo instructions (not counting parameter handling).  The default
value of <i>n</i> is 600.
Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at
the cost of compilation time and memory consumption.  Decreasing usually makes
the compilation faster and less code will be inlined (which presumably
means slower programs).  This option is particularly useful for programs that
use inlining heavily.
<br><br>
Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <b>'--param <i>name</i>=<i>value</i>'</b>.
The <b>'-finline-limit=<i>n</i>'</b> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:
<br><br>
 </p>
<dl>
<p> </p><dt><p><b>max-inline-insns</b></p></dt><dd><p>  is set to <i>n</i>.
 </p></dd><dt><p><b>max-inline-insns-single</b></p></dt><dd><p>  is set to <i>n</i>/2.
 </p></dd><dt><p><b>max-inline-insns-auto</b></p></dt><dd><p>  is set to <i>n</i>/2.
 </p></dd><dt><p><b>min-inline-insns</b></p></dt><dd><p>  is set to 130 or <i>n</i>/4, whichever is smaller.
 </p></dd><dt><p><b>max-inline-insns-rtl</b></p></dt><dd><p>  is set to <i>n</i>.
 </p>
</dd></dl>
<p>
Using <b>'-finline-limit=600'</b> thus results in the default settings
for these parameters.  See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining.
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way, it represents a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fkeep-inline-functions</b></p></dt><dd><p>Even if all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function
is declared <code>static</code>, nevertheless output a separate run-time
callable version of the function.  This switch does not affect
<code>extern&nbsp;inline</code> functions.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fkeep-static-consts</b></p></dt><dd><p>Emit variables declared <code><a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/keywords.html#static">static</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/keywords.html#const">const</a></code> when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.
<br><br>
GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if the variable was referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <b>'-fno-keep-static-consts'</b> option.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fmerge-constants</b></p></dt><dd><p>Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating point
constants) across compilation units.
<br><br>
This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use <b>'-fno-merge-constants'</b> to inhibit this
behavior.
<br><br>
Enabled at levels <b>'-O'</b>, <b>'-O2'</b>, <b>'-O3'</b>, <b>'-Os'</b>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fmerge-all-constants</b></p></dt><dd><p>Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.
<br><br>
This option implies <b>'-fmerge-constants'</b>.  In addition to
<b>'-fmerge-constants'</b> this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating point
types.  C requires each non-automatic variable to have a distinct location,
so using this option will result in non-conforming behavior.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fno-branch-count-reg</b></p></dt><dd><p>Do not use "decrement and branch" instructions on a count register,
but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a

This option is only meaningful on architectures that support such

<b>'-fstrength-reduce'</b> is enabled.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-fno-function-cse</b></p></dt><dd><p>Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that

<br><br>
This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section.  E.g., so that the

<br><br>
The default is RAM/8, with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an

<h2><a name="SEC11"><u>Options Controlling the Preprocessor</u></a></h2>
<p>These options control the <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/cpp.html">C preprocessor</a>, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.
<br><br>
If you use the <b>'-E'</b> option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with <b>'-E'</b> because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.
<br><br>
You can use <b>'-Wp,<i>option</i>'</b> to bypass the compiler driver
and pass <i>option</i> directly through to the preprocessor.  If
<i>option</i> contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
<b>'-Wp'</b> forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct
interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible
you should avoid using <b>'-Wp'</b> and let the driver handle the
options instead.</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>-D <i>name</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Predefine <i>name</i> as a macro, with definition <code>1</code>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-D <i>name</i>=<i>definition</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Predefine <i>name</i> as a macro, with definition <i>definition</i>.
There are no restrictions on the contents of <i>definition</i>, but if
you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you
may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect characters such as
spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.
<br><br>
If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
to quote the option.  With <code>sh</code> and <code>csh</code>,
<b>'-D'<i>name</i>(<i>args...</i>)=<i>definition</i>''</b> works.
<br><br>
<b>'-D'</b> and <b>'-U'</b> options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All <b>'-imacros <i>file</i>'</b> and
<b>'-include <i>file</i>'</b> options are processed after all
<b>'-D'</b> and <b>'-U'</b> options.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-U <i>name</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Cancel any previous definition of <i>name</i>, either built in or

macros remain defined.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-I <i>dir</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Add the directory <i>dir</i> to the list of directories to be searched
for header files.
Directories named by <b>'-I'</b> are searched before the standard
system include directories.  If the directory <i>dir</i> is a standard
system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the
default search order for system directories and the special treatment
of system headers are not defeated
(see <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/cpp.html#SEC9a">System Headers</a>).
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-o <i>file</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Write output to <i>file</i>.  This is the same as specifying <i>file</i>

only if <b>'-trigraphs'</b> was also specified, but now works

they do not affect the meaning of the program.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Wtraditional</b></p></dt><dd><p>Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and problematic constructs which should be avoided.
See <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/cpp.html#SEC70">Traditional Mode</a>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Wimport</b></p></dt><dd><p>Warn the first time <code>#import</code> is used.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Wundef</b></p></dt><dd><p>Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in an
<code>#if</code> directive, outside of <code>defined</code>.  Such identifiers are
replaced with zero.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Wunused-macros</b></p></dt><dd><p>Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is <u>used</u> if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.
<br><br>
Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:</p>
<pre>#if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
#endif
</pre>

</dd><dt><p><b>-Wendif-labels</b></p></dt><dd><p>Warn whenever an <code>#else</code> or an <code>#endif</code> are followed by text.

<pre>#if FOO
...

<p>The second and third <code>FOO</code> should be in comments, but often are not
in older programs.  This warning is on by default.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Werror</b></p></dt><dd><p>Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings
will be rejected.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-Wsystem-headers</b></p></dt><dd><p>Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-w</b></p></dt><dd><p>Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP issues by default.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-pedantic</b></p></dt><dd><p>Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-pedantic-errors</b></p></dt><dd><p>Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that GCC issues
without <b>'-pedantic'</b> but treats as warnings.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-M</b></p></dt><dd><p>Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for <code>make</code> describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one <code>make</code> rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from <b>'-include'</b> or
<b>'-imacros'</b> command line options.
<br><br>
Unless specified explicitly (with <b>'-MT'</b> or <b>'-MQ'</b>), the
object file name consists of the basename of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix.  If there are many included
files then the rule is split into several lines using <code>\</code>-newline.
The rule has no commands.
<br><br>
This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
<b>'-dM'</b>.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
<b>'-MF'</b>, or use an environment variable like
<code>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</code> (see <a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/cpp.html#SEC45">Environment Variables</a>).  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.
<br><br>
Passing <b>'-M'</b> to the driver implies <b>'-E'</b>, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit <b>'-w'</b>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-MM</b></p></dt><dd><p>Like <b>'-M'</b> but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.
<br><br>
This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
<code>#include</code> directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in <b>'-MM'</b> dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-MF <i>file</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>When used with <b>'-M'</b> or <b>'-MM'</b>, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no <b>'-MF'</b> switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.
<br><br>
When used with the driver options <b>'-MD'</b> or <b>'-MMD'</b>,
<b>'-MF'</b> overrides the default dependency output file.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-MG</b></p></dt><dd><p>In conjunction with an option such as <b>'-M'</b> requesting
dependency generation, <b>'-MG'</b> assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
<code>#include</code> directive without prepending any path.  <b>'-MG'</b>
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.
<br><br>
This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-MP</b></p></dt><dd><p>This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors <code>make</code> gives if you remove header
files without updating the <code>Makefile</code> to match.
<br><br>
This is typical output:</p>
<pre>test.o: test.c test.h

test.h:
</pre>

</dd><dt><p><b>-MT <i>target</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default CPP takes the name of the main input file, including any path,
deletes any file suffix such as <code>.c</code>, and appends the platform's
usual object suffix.  The result is the target.
<br><br>
An <b>'-MT'</b> option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to <b>'-MT'</b>, or use multiple <b>'-MT'</b> options.
<br><br>
For example, <b>'-MT '$(objpfx)foo.o''</b> might give</p>
<pre>$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
</pre>

</dd><dt><p><b>-MQ <i>target</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Same as <b>'-MT'</b>, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.
The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
<b>'-MQ'</b>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-MD</b></p></dt><dd><p><b>'-MD'</b> is equivalent to <b>'-M -MF <i>file</i>'</b>, except that
<b>'-E'</b> is not implied.  The driver determines <i>file</i> based on
whether an <b>'-o'</b> option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of <code>.d</code>, otherwise it take the
basename of the input file and applies a <code>.d</code> suffix.
<br><br>
If <b>'-MD'</b> is used in conjunction with <b>'-E'</b>, any
<b>'-o'</b> switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but
if used without <b>'-E'</b>, each <b>'-o'</b>
is understood to specify a target object file.
<br><br>
Since <b>'-E'</b> is not implied, <b>'-MD'</b> can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-MMD</b></p></dt><dd><p>Like <b>'-MD'</b> except mention only user header files, not system
-header files.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-x c</b>
<br><b>-x c++</b>
<br><b>-x objective-c</b>
<br><b>-x assembler-with-cpp</b></p></dt><dd><p>Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or assembly.  This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely
selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:
<code>.c</code>, <code>.cc</code>, <code>.m</code>, or <code>.S</code>.  Some other common
extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.  Note that C++ and Objective-C are not supported in TIGCC.
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> Previous versions of cpp accepted a <b>'-lang'</b> option
which selected both the language and the standards conformance level.

You should be prepared for side effects when using <b>'-C'</b>; it

<h2><a name="SEC14"><u>Options for Directory Search</u></a></h2>
<p>These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>-I<i>dir</i></b></p></dt><dd><p>Add the directory <i>dir</i> to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use <b>'-isystem'</b> for that).  If you use more than
one <b>'-I'</b> option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.
<br><br>
If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
<b>'-isystem'</b>, is also specified with <b>'-I'</b>, the <b>'-I'</b>
option will be ignored.  The directory will still be searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the include_next directive are not inadvertently changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the <b>'-nostdinc'</b> and/or <b>'-isystem'</b> options.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>-I-</b></p></dt><dd><p>Any directories you specify with <b>'-I'</b> options before the <b>'-I-'</b>
option are searched only for the case of <code>#include&nbsp;"<i>file</i>"</code>;
they are not searched for <code>#include&nbsp;&lt;<i>file</i>&gt;</code>.
<br><br>
If additional directories are specified with <b>'-I'</b> options after
the <b>'-I-'</b>, these directories are searched for all <code>#include</code>
directives.  (Ordinarily <i>all</i> <b>'-I'</b> directories are used
this way.)
<br><br>
In addition, the <b>'-I-'</b> option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for <code>#include&nbsp;"<i>file</i>"</code>.  There is no way to
override this effect of <b>'-I-'</b>.  With <b>'-I.'</b> you can specify
searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.
<br><br>
<b>'-I-'</b> does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, <b>'-I-'</b> and <b>'-nostdinc'</b> are
independent.

The compiler will check to see if the path provided by the <b>'-B'</b>
refers to a directory, and if necessary it will add a directory
separator character at the end of the path.
<br><br>
Another way to specify a prefix much like the <b>'-B'</b> prefix is to use
the environment variable <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code>.  See <a href="#SEC45">Environment

<h2><a name="SEC15"><u>GCC Spec Strings</u></a></h2>
<p><code>gcc</code> is a driver program.  It performs its job by invoking a
sequence of other programs to do the work of compiling, assembling and
linking.  GCC interprets its command-line parameters and uses these to
deduce which programs it should invoke, and which command-line options
it ought to place on their command lines.  This behavior is controlled
by <u>spec strings</u>.  In most cases there is one spec string for each
program that GCC can invoke, but a few programs have multiple spec
strings to control their behavior.  The spec strings built into GCC can
be overridden by using the <b>'-specs='</b> command-line switch to specify
a spec file.
<br><br>
<u>Spec files</u> are plaintext files that are used to construct spec
strings.  They consist of a sequence of directives separated by blank
lines.
<br><br>
Since <code>gcc</code> only performs a small part of the tasks in TIGCC, spec
strings are more or less irrelevant.  For details on specs, see the
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Spec-Files.html#Spec%20Files">original documentation</a> on the net.</p>

<h2><a name="SEC16"><u>M680x0 Target Options</u></a></h2>
<p>The GCC compiler used in TIGCC is configured for just one target family:
the Motorola M680x0 (M68k) family.  In the TI-89, TI-92+, and V200 calculators,
an MC68000 processor is used, therefore TIGCC creates code for such a
processor by default.  However, switches specifying the processor model, such
as <b>'-m68020'</b>, still exist, although they are not useful.  However,
there are also options that control the code that is generated specifically
for TI calculators; they also start with <b>'-m'</b>:</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>-mno-bss</b></p></dt><dd><p>Output all uninitialized global or static variables as normal data with
zero content. Note that this leads to different semantics if the program is

</p></dd><dt><p><b>-mlong</b></p></dt><dd><p>Consider type <code>int</code> to be 32 bits wide, like <code>long&nbsp;int</code>.
The <b>'-mshort'</b> option is enabled by default in TIGCC; the negative is
actually <b>'-mnoshort'</b>, but <b>'-mno-short'</b> and <b>'-mlong'</b> have
been added as aliases.  Constants such as <code>INT_MAX</code> are set to the
appropriate values, and <code>__INT_SHORT__</code> will be defined if short

used if no interaction with the operating system is required.  Since library
calls also use the TIOS calling convention, they cannot be used either; you
should disable linking against <code>tigcc.a</code>.  Only use this option if

This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls will indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use <code>extern&nbsp;inline</code> in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without

<h2><a name="SEC45"><u>Environment Variables Affecting GCC</u></a></h2>
<p>This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.
<br><br>
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
<b>'-B'</b>, <b>'-I'</b> and <b>'-L'</b> (see <a href="#SEC14">Options for Directory Search</a>).</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>LANG</b>
<br><b>LC_CTYPE</b>
<br><b>LC_MESSAGES</b>
<br><b>LC_ALL</b></p></dt><dd><p>These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
localization information that allow GCC to work with different
national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale categories
<code>LC_CTYPE</code> and <code>LC_MESSAGES</code> if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is <code>en_UK</code> for English in the United
Kingdom.
<br><br>
The <code>LC_CTYPE</code> environment variable specifies character
classification.  GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a string
end or escape.
<br><br>
The <code>LC_MESSAGES</code> environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.
<br><br>
If the <code>LC_ALL</code> environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of <code>LC_CTYPE</code> and <code>LC_MESSAGES</code>; otherwise, <code>LC_CTYPE</code>
and <code>LC_MESSAGES</code> default to the value of the <code>LANG</code>
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, GCC
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>TMPDIR</b></p></dt><dd><p>If <code>TMPDIR</code> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b></p></dt><dd><p>If <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
<br><br>
If <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code> is not set, GCC will attempt to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it was invoked with.
<br><br>
If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
<br><br>
The default value of <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code> is
<code><i>prefix</i>/lib/gcc-lib/</code> where <i>prefix</i> is the value
of <code>prefix</code> when you ran the <code>configure</code> script.
<br><br>
Other prefixes specified with <b>'-B'</b> take precedence over this prefix.
<br><br>
In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with <code>/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib</code>
(more precisely, with the value of <code>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</code>), GCC tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with <b>'-B<i>foo</i>/'</b>, GCC will search
<code><i>foo</i>/<i>bar</i></code> where it would normally search <code>/usr/local/lib/<i>bar</i></code>.
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>COMPILER_PATH</b></p></dt><dd><p>The value of <code>COMPILER_PATH</code> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <code>PATH</code>.  GCC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>LIBRARY_PATH</b></p></dt><dd><p>The value of <code>LIBRARY_PATH</code> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <code>PATH</code>.  When configured as a native compiler (which TIGCC is <i>not</i>),
GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code>.  Linking
using GCC also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the <b>'-l'</b> option (but directories specified with
<b>'-L'</b> come first).
</p></dd><dt><p><b>LANG</b></p></dt><dd><p>This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for <code>LANG</code> are recognized:
</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>C-JIS</b></p></dt><dd><p>Recognize JIS characters.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>C-SJIS</b></p></dt><dd><p>Recognize SJIS characters.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>C-EUCJP</b></p></dt><dd><p>Recognize EUCJP characters.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p>
If <code>LANG</code> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler will use mblen and mbtowc as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p>Some additional environments variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.</p>
<dl>

<dt><p><b>CPATH</b>
<br><b>C_INCLUDE_PATH</b></p></dt><dd><p>Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like <code>PATH</code>, in which to look for header files.
The special character, <code>PATH_SEPARATOR</code>, is target-dependent and
determined at GCC build time.  For Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.
<br><br>
<code>CPATH</code> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with <b>'-I'</b>, but after any paths given with <b>'-I'</b>
options on the command line.
<br><br>
<code>C_INCLUDE_PATH</code> specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with <b>'-isystem'</b>, but after any
paths given with <b>'-isystem'</b> options on the command line.
<br><br>
In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
<code>CPATH</code> is <code>:/special/include</code>, that has the same
effect as <code>-I.&nbsp;-I/special/include</code>.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b></p></dt><dd><p>If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.
<br><br>
The value of <code>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</code> can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
<code><i>file</i>&nbsp;<i>target</i></code>, in which case the rules are written to
file <i>file</i> using <i>target</i> as the target name.
<br><br>
In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options <b>'-MM'</b> and <b>'-MF'</b>
(see <a href="#SEC11">Options Controlling the Preprocessor</a>),
with an optional <b>'-MT'</b> switch, too.
</p></dd><dt><p><b>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</b></p></dt><dd><p>This variable is the same as <code>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</code> (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
<b>'-M'</b> rather than <b>'-MM'</b>
(see <a href="#SEC11">Options Controlling the Preprocessor</a>).
However, the dependence on the main input file is omitted.</p>
